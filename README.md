### Command Palette:

- **Access:** Open with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
- **Examples:** Install extensions (`ext install ...`), change the theme (`Preferences: Color Theme`), manage Git (`Git: Pull`, `Git: Push`).

### Extensions in VS Code:

- **Role:** Extend functionality (e.g., language support, debuggers).
- **Find/Install/Manage:** Access through Extensions view (Activity Bar > Extensions).
- **Examples:** `Live Server` for web development, `Debugger for Chrome` for debugging JavaScript in Chrome.

### Integrated Terminal:

- **Open:** `Ctrl+` \`
